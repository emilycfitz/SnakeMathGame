                    <div class="rcontent">
                        <p>The order of operations is a set of rules which must be kept in mind when doing math problems. These rules tell people when to perform various operations in a math problem with mixed operations, such as (7 + 2) x 4 - 3. There are a number of possible answers to this problem, depending on the order in which the multiplication, subtraction, and addition are performed, but only one right answer, because the order of operations tells people how to do the problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>According to the order of operations, when one is faced with a math problem which has mixed operations, anything in parentheses should be done first, followed by exponents and roots, and then, working from left to right, multiplication and division. Finally, also working from left to right, addition and subtraction. People sometimes use the acronym PEMDAS, for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction, to remember the order of operations. 
                        </p>

                <div>
                    <div class="rtitle">Order of operations 2</div>
                    <div class="rcontent">
                        <p>Taking the problem in the example above, the first thing to do would be the addition inside the parenthesis, 7+2, which equals 9. Next, the multiplication should be done, to reach 36. Finally, the 3 must be subtracted, for a total of 33. The order of operations applies to any math problem, from simple to complex. If there weren't a particular order established, people could come up with equally correct results. For example, someone could read the above problem and come up with an answer of 9, by adding 7+2 to get 9, subtracting 3 from 4 to get 1, and multiplying 9 by 1 to arrive at 9.
                        </p>
                        <p>In a way, the order of operations tells people how to read math problems, just like the rules of grammar tell people how to read written languages. The rules of grammar and mathematics are both designed to make sure that everyone can write and read in a universal way which ensures that people can communicate freely with people they may never personally interact with. The standardization created by the order of operations is especially important in mathematics because there are so many ways to work complex problems without it, and this would result in a multitude of conflicting answers.

                    <div class="rcontent">
                        <p>In mathematics, an arithmetic progression (AP) or arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between the consecutive terms is constant. For instance, the sequence 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 … is an arithmetic progression with common difference of 2.
                        </p>
                        <p>If the initial term of an arithmetic progression is a_1 and the common difference of successive members is d, then the nth term of the sequence (a_n) is given by:<br />
                        a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d,<br />
                        and in general<br />
                        a_n = a_m + (n - m)d.<br />
                        A finite portion of an arithmetic progression is called a finite arithmetic progression and sometimes just called an arithmetic progression. The sum of a finite arithmetic progression is called an arithmetic series. <br />
                        </p>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <div class="rtitle">Arithmetic progression 2</div>
                    <div class="rcontent">
                        <p>If<br />
                        a_1 is the first term of an arithmetic progression.<br />
                        a_n is the nth term of an arithmetic progression.<br />
                        d is the difference between terms of the arithmetic progression. <br />
                        n is the number of terms in the arithmetic progression.<br />
                        S_n is the sum of n terms in the arithmetic progression.<br />
                        </p>
                        <p>To derive the above formula, begin by expressing the arithmetic series in two different ways:<br />

                            S_n=a_1+(a_1+d)+(a_1+2d)+\cdots+(a_1+(n-2)d)+(a_1+(n-1)d) <br />
                            S_n=(a_n-(n-1)d)+(a_n-(n-2)d)+\cdots+(a_n-2d)+(a_n-d)+a_n. <br />
                            Adding both sides of the two equations, all terms involving d cancel:<br />

                            2S_n=n(a_1 + a_n).<br />
                            Dividing both sides by 2 produces a common form of the equation:<br />

                            S_n=\frac{n}{2}( a_1 + a_n).<br />
                        </p>

                    <div class="rtitle">Geometric progression 1</div>
                    <div class="rcontent">
                        <p>In mathematics, a geometric progression, also known as a geometric sequence, is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression with common ratio 3. Similarly 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, ... is a geometric sequence with common ratio 1/2.
                        </p>
                        <p>Examples of a geometric sequence are powers rk of a fixed number r, such as 2k and 3k. The general form of a geometric sequence is <br />a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4, <br />where r ≠ 0 is the common ratio and a is a scale factor, equal to the sequence's start value.
                        </p>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <div class="rtitle">Geometric progression 2</div>
                    <div class="rcontent">
                        <p>The behaviour of a geometric sequence depends on the value of the common ratio.
                            If the common ratio is:

                            Positive, the terms will all be the same sign as the initial term.
                            Negative, the terms will alternate between positive and negative.
                            Greater than 1, there will be exponential growth towards positive or negative infinity (depending on the sign of the initial term).
                            1, the progression is a constant sequence.
                            Between −1 and 1 but not zero, there will be exponential decay towards zero.
                            −1, the progression is an alternating sequence
                            Less than −1, for the absolute values there is exponential growth towards (unsigned) infinity, due to the alternating sign.
                        </p>
                        <p>Geometric sequences (with common ratio not equal to −1, 1 or 0) show exponential growth or exponential decay, as opposed to the linear growth (or decline) of an arithmetic progression such as 4, 15, 26, 37, 48, … (with common difference 11). This result was taken by T.R. Malthus as the mathematical foundation of his Principle of Population. Note that the two kinds of progression are related: exponentiating each term of an arithmetic progression yields a geometric progression, while taking the logarithm of each term in a geometric progression with a positive common ratio yields an arithmetic progression.<br />

                        An interesting result of the definition of a geometric progression is that for any value of the common ratio, any three consecutive terms a, b and c will satisfy the following equation:<br />

                        b^2=ac<br />
                        where b is considered to be the geometric mean between a and c.<br />
